**This lil’guy may look innocent, but his true passion lies in taking down cute animals and thriving on their blood.**

Equipped with a sword, this lil’guy can perform single and double slash combos, slicing through enemies with style. Earn points by defeating enemies, and build combos by achieving multikills. But be careful—take a hit, and your combo resets. After three hits, lil’guy needs a break. Your final score can be uploaded to an online leaderboard, where you can compete for the top spot. Keep an eye out for rare special enemies to boost your score even higher.

## overview

This game — code, art, animation, playtesting, and sound—was developed by me as a yearly project during my first year at the Salzburg University of Applied Sciences. The music was composed by my brother, Sebastian Schweiger, and the voice acting was performed by Saida Feitl.

## goals

My goal was to polish a simple concept to a high standard. I focused on creating flexible, reusable systems—GameObjects, Components, UI, Music, and Shaders. The emphasis was on a satisfying gameplay experience and a solid foundation for further development.

## learnings

Built entirely from scratch in C# using SFML, the game required creating all elements—UI, buttons, animations, scenes, and game objects—from the ground up. I also designed all the art assets in Adobe Illustrator, aiming for a modern and coherent art style. The focus was on replayability and enjoyment.

## reception

The game was well received, with over 500 leaderboard entries within two weeks of its release. It also got praised for it's well rounded nature and clean art style.
